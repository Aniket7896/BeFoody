# BeFoody - Food Delivery Application
BeFoody is a full-stack food delivery application built using React, Node.js, MongoDB, CSS, Bootstrap 5, Express, JWT, and Bcrypt. This application showcases my proficiency in web development and provides a seamless user experience for ordering and enjoying delicious food.

## Frontend Technologies Used:

- **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap:** We've used HTML and CSS, with Bootstrap 5, to create an appealing and responsive user interface. Bootstrap ensures that the application is visually appealing and adapts to different screen sizes.

- **JavaScript:** JavaScript adds interactivity to the website, making it more engaging and dynamic.

- **React JS:** The frontend is built using React JS, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of reusable UI components, enhancing the maintainability and scalability of the application.

## Backend Technologies Used:
